I used my already existing portfolio code and added a few features such as more images, more content types, more colors, and use only HTML instead of how it was (using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript). I just got to use the W3 library from the site template to find special fonts and colors. This was the hardest part of the project but, with a bit of research, I got to find it and use it in my code.
